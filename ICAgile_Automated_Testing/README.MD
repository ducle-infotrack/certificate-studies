## Defining Your Test Automation Strategy

### Understanding the Components of a Testing Automation Strategy

- Testing Automation much more than just Unit Test
- Automated tests intended to test the code at different levels
    - **Unit Tests**: *Exercises a single piece of code*
    - **Component Tests**: *Validates that multiple areas of code work correctly together*
    - **Acceptance Testes**: *Ensures an area of code is following a specified business rule*

#### Unit Tests

- Executes quickly
- Independent of other unit tests
- Exercises a single piece of code 
- Designed to be used in isolation

> A unit test's small area of focus often makes it simpler to maintain than other types of tests

#### Component Tests

- Ensures multiple pieces of code interact properly
- Provides a higher level of confidence about the overall codebase
- Can be more complex to maintain

#### Acceptance Testes

- Validates an area of code is following a defined business rule
- Tends to be readable by non-technical team members
    - Might evolve Product Owner assists
- Can be the most complex to maintain
